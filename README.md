# NexusBanking: A Scalable Banking Platform

## Project Description
NexusBanking is a sample banking operations platform created to demonstrate software engineering, data engineering, database management, machine learning, and system design techniques.

This project is not intended for commercial use, and while I will try to align real world use cases with the best technology, whenever that is not possible I will favor demonstrating the usage of a particular tool/technology.

## Key Features
- **Banking Operations API** – Account management, transactions, and loan processing.
- **Scalability & Performance** – Optimized database queries, caching, and horizontal scaling.
- **Data Pipelines & Analytics** – ETL processes, real-time data processing, and historical transaction analysis.
- **Fraud Detection & Risk Analysis** – ML-based fraud detection and real-time alerts.
- **Regulatory Compliance Automation** – Audit trails and automated reporting.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis, PostgresSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j
- **Data Pipelines:** Apache Airflow, DBT, Kafka
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Security:** JWT authentication, AES-256 encryption, RBAC
- **Testing & Deployment:** Pytest, Docker, GitHub Actions
